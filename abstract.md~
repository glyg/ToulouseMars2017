# Modeling living tyssue at the cellular level

Biology is going 3D. Today's microscopes acquire 3D data with single
molecule accuracy, short time scales, while today's biochemistry and
genetics allow the production of functional 3D cell cultures.

But these technological evolutions come with numerical chalenges.
The first of those, data handling and image analysis,
In this presentation, I will give a brief
