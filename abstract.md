# Modeling living tyssue at the cellular level

Cell biology is going 3D. Today's microscopes acquire 3D data with single
molecule accuracy and short time scales, while today's biochemistry and
genetics allow the production of functional 3D cell systems.

The large amount of spatio-temporal data generated is both a chalenge
and an opportunity. As a software editor Morphog√©nie seeks to address
those issues and seize those opportunities. I will present our work on
cell based models of living tissues, it's current possiblities and
planned developements. I'll finally discuss the possible
application of these tools to organoids modelling.
